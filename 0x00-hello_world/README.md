# Simple C basics

## stages of C code

- **Preprocessing** -> Remove comments, expand macros & include headers
- **Compiling** -> Translates preprocessed code to assembly language
- **Assembly** -> Conversion of assembly code into object code(machine code)
- **Linking** -> links object files with libraries, resolves symbols
- **Execution** -> OS loads executable, runs it.
